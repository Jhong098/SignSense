if the sign involves a gesture it is a nonhold
if the sign is simply a hand shape it is a hold

Store signs videos in a directory named with the label of the signs. 

at any point videos can be rewatched with a mp overlay to ensure the tracking is good using the following holistic.py command

python holistic.py multi <video dir> <start index>
* note this will create a folder in the video directory called mp with your videos with the mp overlay
* it will also display the tracking as it happens, press q on the video window to skip to the next vid.

for example if I want to verify my current vids are tracking well for a sign apple I would use
python holistic.py multi C:\signs\apple 0

or to start at the 10th video I would do 

python holistic.py multi C:\signs\apple 9

RECORDING

hold videos should be done as follows:
    - length in multiples of 10 + 1 second for setup at start to get mediapipe to recognize the hand
    - data can be in as many videos as needed as long as the total recorded length is > 240 seconds
    - in past I have done many 11 second videos with a few longer videos once I'm certain the gesture I'm making is tracking well in mediapipe

non holds videos as follows:
    - 1 video per sign iteration
    - keep videos at or below 2 seconds including setup time
    - in past I have recorded a minimum 60 vids for these signs, but the more the better

store vids in the following structure
-> videos
    -> apple
        -> vid1.mp4
        -> vid2.mp4
        -> ...
    -> orange
    -> etc...

DATA GENERATION

once vids are recorded generate data using the following holistic.py command

python holistic.py dataset <dir with sign subdirs> <output directory>

using the structure above, the following command:
    pythong holistic.py dataset /path/to/videos /output

will generate an output structure like this:
-> output
    -> apple
        -> vid1.npy
        -> vid2.npy
        -> ...
    -> orange
    -> etc...

this is the data, it can then be sorted into the hold and non hold directory
